**Telegram Bot README**
**Description**
This Python script serves as the foundation for a Telegram bot using the python-telegram-bot library. The bot responds to the "/start" command and handles incoming text messages by acknowledging receipt and notifying the user that assistance is on the way.

**Prerequisites**
**Python 3.x**
python-telegram-bot library
**Installation**
Install the required dependencies:


pip install python-telegram-bot nest_asyncio
Update the API-KEY placeholder in the script with your actual Telegram Bot API key.

If you are running the script on a Windows system, make sure to uncomment the lines related to the event loop policy to address compatibility issues.

**Usage**
**Run the script:**


python your_script_name.py
Start a conversation with the bot on Telegram using the "/start" command, and it will respond with a greeting.

Send a text message to the bot, and it will acknowledge receipt and inform the user that assistance is pending.

**Additional Notes**
The script uses asyncio for asynchronous operations, and nest_asyncio is applied to handle nested event loops.
Make sure to replace the placeholder API-KEY with the actual API key obtained from the BotFather on Telegram.
**Disclaimer**
This script is a basic template and may require further customization based on specific bot functionality requirements. Refer to the python-telegram-bot documentation for more advanced features and usage examples.
